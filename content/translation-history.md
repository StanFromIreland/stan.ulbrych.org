# python-docs-pl: History

I've always liked reflecting on the past, for without it, there would be no
present. And so, with help from Maciek with milestones that predate me,
I compiled a little chart that shows [python-docs-pl](https://github.com/python/python-docs-pl)'s
progress since it's inital commit, roughly six years ago.

The result was quite surprising to me, as I presumed the workshops would align
more with jumps, but many remain unexplained. The data is also not ideal, as
all the progress calculations are based on the current branch. It would have
simply taken too long otherwise, dealing with dependencies and building it so
many times that my CPU would melt. I may return to this in the future...
